Lets install the relevant R libraries.

```{r}
library(fitdistrplus)
install.packages("pastecs")

```
Read data into workspace.

Identify which distribution generated which column. 
Estimate the parameters of each distributions (e.g. Maximum Likelihood estimation). 
You may want to use different plotting techniques and manipulation previously seen in class.

```{r}
Data <- read.csv("~/Coding/R/R Assessments/Statistical Inference/Assessment 1/R_assessment1_data.csv")

```



```{r}
plot(cars)
```
